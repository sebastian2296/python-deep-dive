- Complex: numbers with a real part and an imaginary part.
- Decimals: floats with a specified precision in memory.
- fractions

## Collections

*Sequences* 

- Mutable: Lists

- Immutable: Tuples

Things we can invoke; a function, for example.

An extensive list:

- User-defined functions
- Generators
- Classes
- Instance Methods
- Class instances
- Built-in functions (len(), open())
- Built-in methods (append() in lists f.e)

## Singletons

- None: when we set an object to none it always points to the same memory address.
- NotImplemented
- Ellipsis
